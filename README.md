NFT HACKATHON PROJECT FILES


1. Mining: Seed a DAO by scraping graffiti data, and achieved by minting a digital asset from a physical resource. (Blockchain)
2. Community building: Onboard users by opening the pilot to the residents of the communities most impacted by graffiti
3. Tokenomics: Let the market assign a new valuation on this art that disappears. Start a clock.  
4. Incentivize: create actors/actions related to adding to the platform that drive renewal (disruption).
5. Market the DAO: Use this innovative hybrid as social proof to graffiti comminities. Onboard them, thus kicking off the flywheel.
